<h2>Juicy steak</h2>
    <p>This is the alpha male way of preparing a steak, as inspired by Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation</p>
    <p>Try it out for yourself and save time putting together elaborate recipes to simply enjoy a good steak.</p>
    
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>First you marinate it with salt and whatever other spices of your choosing, but it is usually best to stick to it as simple as possible, salt + black pepper.</li>
    <li>Then heat up your grill (or pan if you don't have one) as much as you can. Once that is done, deploy your steak and cook it up to your preferred level and flip it. The key is to flip only once.</li>
    <li>Once it is ready, let it breath and cool down for a few minutes before eating. Enjoy!</li>
